Fraud sms detection using machine learning

Mobile phones are an essential part of daily life, and receiving SMS or email messages is a routine activity. However, many of these messages are spam, designed to trick users into divulging personal information like passwords, account numbers, or Social Security numbers. With such information, scammers can potentially access sensitive accounts like email or banking.

This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms  to identify and filter out SMS spam effectively.
We will be utilizing the SMS Spam Detection Dataset, which comprises SMS text messages and their respective labels (Ham or Spam).
